# Simple Django Hello-world web app

I'm tryin' to learn Django for the first time. This project is not intended to be used in production. It's just a fricking example.

# How to run this (cuz i'm to lazy to properly deploy it)
```console
$ # first install django
$ pip install django
$ # now you can run it
$ python manage.py runserver
```

If you have a bad request error (400) on your browser, you can change the file `hello_django/settings.py` adding your host to the constant list `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
